I expected it to be a long task but hugo's framework is really easy to use and setup.

After spending some time on choosing a theme, it did not take much time to setup this article and design the static website.

Setting up the page on github was also an easy task after comitting and pushing the changes to the website repository and adding a .github/workflow/gh-pages.yml file

I did face one issue while deploying the static page on github because my gh-pages.yml file was named incorrectly

Overall this task was fun to do and a great learning experience without many hiccups and obstacles
